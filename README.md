## Project Summary

This project investigates the effects of the **Affordable Care Act (ACA)** on **health insurance coverage** and **educational attainment** across **Ohio census tracts** between **2012 and 2022**. Our analysis visualizes the spatial shifts and quantifies how the ACA, particularly **Medicaid expansion in 2014**, impacted urban and rural communities.

## Research Questions

- Did health insurance coverage improve in Ohio between 2012 and 2022?
- How is health coverage correlated with educational attainment?
- What spatial patterns emerge across urban vs. rural areas?
- What role did Medicaid expansion play in reducing uninsured rates?

---

## Data Sources

All data was collected from the **U.S. Census Bureau**:

- **Insurance Data**: [ACS Table S2701 – 5-Year Estimates]  
- **Education Data**: [ACS Table B15003 – 5-Year Estimates]
